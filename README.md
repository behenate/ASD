# ASD - Algorithms and Data Structures
The repository contains solutions to over two hundred coding tasks ranging from sorting algorithms, through dynamic and greedy algorithms to graph algorithms. All of the solutions have been written in `Python`.

The repository is divided into three main sections

- Sorting Algorithms
- Dynamic and greedy algorithms
- Graph Algorithms

They were all solved for Algorithms and Data Structures course on AGH UST.
